# NBA_Player_Analysis

## Project Overview

Using machine learning to analyze player decline in the NBA. This analysis will aim to provide insight on the following questions:

1. Based on the player archtype, when will the athlete begin to experience a decline in performance?
2. Once the player has begun to decline, will adjusting the athletes playstyle help avoid regression?

## Dataset

- [NBA Python API](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/)
- [Kaggle Player Data](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=player_data.csv)
  - A data [sample](ETL/data_processing/SAMPLE_DATA.xlsx) has been drafted. 

## Communication Protocols

- **Slack**: Team discussions, questions, suggestisons & resource sharing.
- **Google Meet**: Team meetings, discussions
- **[Trello](https://trello.com/b/bpUG9Aoh/final-project-nba)**: Work organization, scheduling
